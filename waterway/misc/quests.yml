    - Water Pearls are known to be a powerful ingredient, so maybe it will improve this terrible sword of mine.

    - And then I'll try and convince him to stay at home instead of following this ridiculous dream of his.
  dialog-during:
    - I must say, negotiation is not going well.
    - By slaying a REDTitanWHITE, you'll weaken the rest of them, which means Jim might actually survive..
  dialog-finishing:
    - You actually slew a Titan?
    - Congrats!
    - Perfectly timed, I must say.
    - I've vastly improved Jim's weapon, but unfortunately I have not managed to convince him to abandon this quest.
    - I'll leave him in your capable hands. Bye!
